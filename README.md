# flirt-web-app

Flirt, is a responsive web application where crypto enthusiasts, artists, and the monster-curious can dive deep into a rich, animated library. Each creature is more than a picture; They have their own story with lore, sounds, and immersive details. Users swipe to express their awe or fear, shaping their journey through our crypto collection.

Objectives/Motivations
The objectives/motivations behind this project is to develop a responsive web application that allows users to browse a large library of monster pictures and indicate their preferences with "swipes". This is achieved through the use of a dynamic and intuitive interface, efficient backend handling, and robust database deign to mange the database.

Furthermore, the design plan will be presented to stakeholders, and upon approval, the project will proceed with a development following Agile methodologies, with regular sprints and iterations based on feedback Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
